This contains my user settings for things like vim and bash aliases

## Todo once initial setup is done:
1. Install and set up Nextcloud client
2. Install Lastpass firefox extension
3. Install [vimix](https://github.com/vinceliuice/vimix-gtk-themes)
4. Install [paper](https://snwh.org/paper/download)
5. Install ublock origin if needed
6. Install omf and grab bobthefish theme (can be automated soon)
